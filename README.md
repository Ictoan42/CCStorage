# CCStorage
A modular storage system program for the ComputerCraft mod for Minecraft

I'll get around to doing a readme soon.

Promise.

# TODO:

- this README
- launch shortcuts in root
- crafting perhaps?

Bug fixes:
- clean to correct chest is failing with "tried to sort non existant item" error
- "get one stack" often gets less than a stack
- explicit error check that dest chest exists when cleaning to correct storage chest

For Manager:
- add a "remap" function to move registered items
- some kind of misc. storage
- some kind of bulk storage (multi chest per item)
