# CCStorage
A modular storage system program for the ComputerCraft mod for Minecraft

I'll get around to doing a readme soon.

Promise.

TODO:

- explicit error check that dest chest exists when cleaning to correct storage chest
- clean to correct chest is failing with "tried to sort non existant item" error
- add a "remap" function to move registered items
- this README
- launch shortcuts in root
- register should return the number of item TYPES registered
- single-retrieve mode for the TUI
- some kind of misc. storage
- some kind of bulk storage (multi chest per item)
- crafting perhaps?
